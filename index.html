<p>If you need more help, consider posting to the friendly gang on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/flot-graphs">forum/mailing list</a>. You can probably save yourself some time skimming the <a href="https://github.com/flot/flot/blob/master/FAQ.md">FAQ</a> first.</p>

<h2>Bugs, patches suggestions</h2>
<p>Bugs in Flot can be reported <a href="https://github.com/flot/flot/issues">on the issue tracker</a> - <i>but please be polite and report only confirmed bugs and enhancements</i>. Unless you spot an obvious mistake in Flot or can produce a small self-contained test case reproducing the problem (ideally based on one of the examples), you are probably better off asking on the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/flot-graphs">forums</a>, which are watched by the development team and many other knowledgeable people.</p>
<p>As for new features, you can open an issue or send a pull request on <a href="https://github.com/flot/flot">Github</a>. Note that Flot is currently in a process of slimming the core in favour of placing the features in plugins, and new features should generally follow the same trend.</p>
